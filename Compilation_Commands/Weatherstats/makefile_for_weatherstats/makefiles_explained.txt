Purpose of makefiles
********************

The purpose of a "makefile" is to automate the building proccess of the executable programs.

With a "makefile":

_there is no need for seperately compiling each ".c" files into ".o" files
one at a time.

_there is no need for linking each ".o" files to the final executable

The need to type all these commands and the compiler flags causes complete nuisance. With
a "makefile" such inconveniences are irradicated, at least it simplifies the build process.
